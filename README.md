- How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

You interpret user needs and implement them into programs by understanding what value the need brings to the user. What outcome does the user expect from any given feature. Applying user stories a Product Owner can assist development by formatting feature request in a way that clearly defines the value that any given feature brings to the user or shareholders.

- How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

  I've worked on a lot of personal programming projects outside of school. Usually they're game related but not necessarily games. For example, I once created a "Shop Generator" for Dungeons and Dragons. It generated a store, its owner, the items the store stocks, and the individual amount and price of each item. Users could refine the generation by changing settings such as the size of the shop, the prevalence of magic in their world, and the health of the given economy that the shop was in. When I built this I specifically considered the needs of the average DM running a D&D campaign. I think in the future if I were to incorporate any Agile practices into my solo work it would be the task structure. I really like how tasks are organized, prioritized, and burned down in Agile. This definitely would've sped up many of my personal projects.
I've never actually worked on a project with someone else before but If I were to do so I think I would like to adopt most of the Agile Process. I really like the Autonomy developers are given within the Agile structure, and it seems like a great way to work!
  
- What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

  Being accountable and taking responsibility for your own actions is the most important part of being a good team member. In software development others are consistently relying on your work and it's the duty of every team member to pull their own weight.
